<p class="bodytext">The trail Danielle and I followed through the park runs parralel to this stream which runs out into Tod Inlet. The forest around the stream is
rich with moisture and the life that feeds on it. Ferns, moss, fungi, animals all grow fat off the abundance of our wonderful island.
The water is clean and beautiful, and the sound of the rushing rapids is soothing to the spirit.</p><br>

<div id="waterfall">

</div>

<p class="bodytext">
There are many wonderful views of this stream to be enjoyed. Waterfalls, rapids, bridges, cairns, all give this particular stream a lot of character.
A good length of it can be seen from the main trail but to fully enjoy the beauty of this natural wonder, you should take the side paths that lead
down to the bank; who knows what secrets you can find on these little trails ;). The log bridge that crosses the stream is a neat little feature. It
let's you feel a little adventurous and offers a nice view of the cairns pictured below.</p><br> 

<div id="waterfallinfo">
<p><i>Oh look, a waterfall! Very nice view from the main path (where this photo was taken).</i></p>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">These cairns are really the coolest thing here. They are one of the main reasons I suggest taking a closer look than is offered
by the main path. You must be careful though as the area is sensitive and a lot of work is being done right now to restore the area. So please respect
nature while enjoying it, so that others can enjoy it the same way.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
These pictures really only scratch the surface of what is here to see. If you are going to Gowlland Provincial Park for the first time I recommend
parking on Wallace rd. and walking in along the path that follows the stream to the inlet. It is an easy and short trail but with so many wonderful
sights in such a small area you can spend a whole day taking it in.</p>

<div id="threecairnsinfo">
<p><i>So cool! There are many of these all the way down the stream. Much more pleasing to the eye than some of the garbage left around...</i></p>
