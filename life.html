<p><i>There is an amazing variety of mushrooms here. Can someone please identify these for me? They are very pretty.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">
Tod Inlet and the stream that runs out into it is fertile ground. A great diversity of life thrives here. The forest is rich with moisture and nutrient-rich
soil. Old growth feeds new life, and the forest floor in particular is full of moss, grasses, fledgeling pines, ferns, and much more. I'm sure before it became
populated by people and the stream poluted, larger mammals would have made this a preferred watering hole.

<div id="slug">

</div>

<p class="bodytext">
Bugs, bugs, lizards, and more bugs. There are slugs, snails, ants, spiders, beetles, snakes, salamanders; all sorts of things scurry along the floor and the
underside of bushes, ferns, and fallen trees. Watch your step: you might squish someone's home, or the occupant, or both. Hopefully you are not too squeamish
about these things if you plan on visiting.

<p><i>So many wonderful creatures live in these waters, but the effects of man's (e.g. white men) presence here has been devastating.</i></p>
</div>


<p class="bodytext">
This place is a bird watchers paradise. We saw woodpeckers, ravens, eagles, robins, and all manner of other birds that I am not capable of identifying.
The forest teems with thier songs. This creates a wonderful atmosphere and combined with the sounds of the rushing water and the scenic trees anyone is 
sure to find peace in this place.
</p><br>

<p class="bodytext">
There is certainly a lot of seafood to be had here. I am not sure what, if anything (probably not), you are allowed to fish. There are lots of fish that live in the
inlet. Crustatians that walk along the floor would make a fine feast if you ask me... So would the clams, mussles, and oysters that abound near the stream entrance
into the inlet.
