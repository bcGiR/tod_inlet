This is what I come here for -- the trees! There are a great variety of trees in Gowlland Tod Provincial Park: Firs, Pines, Cedars, Maples, Oaks, Poplars, and
others that I don't know because I am not that knowledgable. Some of them grow very tall. It makes for a nice walk through the forest as you are in the shade most
of the time, so even though it gets hot, at least you are not exposed directly to the sun.

The variety of trees is very nice. There are gary oak meadows, poplar groves, and thick foests of evergreens of course. Down by the stream things get really cool.
Here, the trees are covered in moss, mushrooms, and other life that uses them to grow. Some of the tallest trees have great mossy vests that cover their every limb.

<div id="shroomsinfo">
<p><i>Mushrooms like these abound on the trees closer to the stream. Some of them grow quite large. The largest I've seen was around 12 inches in diameter</i></p>

<div id="cedarstripsinfo">
<p><i>These cedars are stripped of a little of their bark by the indigenous peoples and used for a variety of crafts.</i></p>

I love Victoria for this reason. Even in the city we have many trees on boulevards and in parks. When you get out of the city the island is one big rainforest
just full of opportunities for amazement and wonder. I imagine that too much exposure to concrete and artificial materials makes a persons brain start to become
imbalanced. It's my hope that these walks through the forest are a balancing force for my psyche. Springtime is the perfect time for a walk in this park.
Green leaves and colourful blossoms all around.
