Today Danielle and I went out to Tod Inlet on a day trip.
We saw many cool things in our trip but it was just nice to be in nature.
We have not really had a nice trip out to the forest like this since last summer.
I took lots of pictures and so did Danielle and as such I will be
updating this site with lots of pretty pictures and cool things to click on.
This will serve as a practice for basic webpage layout.

<p><i>These Cairns can be found in the stream all the way down to the inlet. They look especially cool
and ancient with the moss that grows on them. </i></p>

<p class="bodytext">Being outdoors is spiritual food for Danielle and I. We need the outdoors to lift our spirits,
to give our souls calm. It is great exercise as well; you don't realize how hard you are working until the end.
Being out in nature together is very good for all aspects of the wellness wheel (or so I am told) and I can
believe it since I still feel so good a day after being out there. Danielle and I will have to have many
more adventures this summer. Come september, I will be ready for another round of school.</p>
